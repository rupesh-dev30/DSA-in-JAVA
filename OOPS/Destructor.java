/*
    Destructor:

    - It is a special method that automatically gets called when an object is no longer used. When an object completes its life-cycle the garbage collector deletes that object and deallocates or releases the memory occupied by the object.

    - Destructors are used to release the resources that are allocated to an object.

    - Destructors are also known as the finalizer method.

    - No need to create destructor in java.
