1. Introduction to Stack

      Stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle.

      Elements are added (pushed) and removed (popped) from the top of the stack.


2. Stack Operations

      push(element): Adds an element to the top of the stack.

      pop(): Removes and returns the top element of the stack.

      peek(): Returns the top element of the stack without 
      removing it.
      
      isEmpty(): Checks if the stack is empty.

      size(): Returns the number of elements in the stack.


3. Implementing Stack using java.util.Stack

      Java provides a built-in Stack class as part of the java.util package.
