// A Heap is a complete binary tree data structure that satisfies the heap property: for every node, the value of its children is greater than or equal to its own value. Heaps are usually used to implement priority queues, where the smallest (or largest) element is always at the root of the tree.

/*
    Binary Tree:
      at most 2 children

    Complete Binary Tree: 
      CBT is a BT in which all the levels are completley filled except possibly the last one, which is filled from left to right

    Heap Order Property: 
      Children >= Parent(maxHeap)
      Children <= Parent(minHeap)
